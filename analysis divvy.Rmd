## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

What is the overall distribution of users?

• What is the average number of bike trips per user category?
```{r}

What is the most common bike trip length?

```{r}

timeseries

What is the average number of bike trips per user category?
 What is the most common bike trip length?
 What is the range of bike trip length
 Ride distribution by user type and day of week.using time series
• Ride distribution by time of day.using time series
• The most popular usage time e.g. hour, month, day, season etc.
• Ride distribution by month.

with visualiztion

Number of Stations
• Station Analysis i.e. Most and least popular stations per user status
(Casual Customer and Subscriber).
• The top 10 most visited stations by subscriber riders aggregated by
"Number of trips" and "Station name".
• The top 10 most visited stations by casual riders  aggregated by "Number 
of trips" and "Station name

Geographic Distribution

: Perform geographic distribution of ride
requests using longitude and latitude.
• Spatial Clustering: Perform spatial clustering analysis to identify regions
with high bike ride activity. This can help in identifying areas where
additional bike-sharing infrastructure may be needed

• Analyze the difference in ride duration between the two groups using
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance Statistical Test).
• Report on Findings.
